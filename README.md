here is every command:
Add -> addition, you have to put only two numbers for example you do:
  Add
  1 -> first input
  1 -> second input
  2 -> output

same goes for Subs(substraction),Mult(multiplication) and Divi(division), YOU NEED TO PUT ONLY TWO NUMBERS

for sin cos tan...:
  you type the name of the function and CHOOSE ONLY ONE NUMBER
  example usage:
    sin -> text input
    1 -> number input
    0.841470984808 -> output
