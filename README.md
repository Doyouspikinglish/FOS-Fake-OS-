FOS means Fake OS. 

Warning: I used too many else ifs, it is a demo, the finished version will probably have from 300 to 1000 lines of code with IFS AND ELSE IFS

here is every command:
Add -> addition, you have to put only two numbers for example you do:
  Add
  1 -> first input
  1 -> second input
  2 -> output

same goes for Subs(substraction),Mult(multiplication) and Divi(division), YOU NEED TO PUT ONLY TWO NUMBERS

for sin cos tan...:
  you type the name of the function and CHOOSE ONLY ONE NUMBER
  example usage:
    sin -> text input
    1 -> number input
    0.841470984808 -> output

loop++:
  loop++ is to make a loop of a string from up to down
loop+:
 loop+ is a loop of a string from left to right

 cr.file:
   mocks making a file, it cant be saved or opened. the file system is in the prototyping stage
   command to quit: Quit.quit/command

cls:
  clears the screen

pointer* :
  this is just a test for the const char pointer, you can ignore right now
